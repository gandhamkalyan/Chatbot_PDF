 Chatbot PDF – Chat with Your PDFs Using LLMs
chatbot_pdf is a simple yet powerful Streamlit application that lets you upload a PDF and interact with it using natural language. It uses LLMs (like GPT models) to understand the content of the PDF and answer questions based on the document.

You can ask:

“Summarize this document”

“What does the second chapter say?”

“Who is the author and what’s the main idea?”
